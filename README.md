## VHRA

Infrastructure engineer based in New York City with 2+ years building 
and operating production systems on AWS and Kubernetes. I've shipped 
CI/CD pipelines, containerized backend services, resolved critical 
production failures, and increased test coverage from 40% to 75% on 
live systems.

Currently building autonomous agent networks where AI agents interact, 
learn from each other using episodic vector memory, and evolve behavior 
over time — applied reinforcement learning in a real system.

Open to backend, platform, and agentic systems roles.
